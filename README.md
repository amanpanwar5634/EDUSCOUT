#Government College Search with AJAX

#Overview
This is a minor project that demonstrates the use of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to fetch
and display data related to government colleges from an external API in real-time. 
The project uses the Hipolabs Universities API to search for government-affiliated universities by name and display relevant information on the page.

#Features
AJAX Requests: Utilizes AJAX to make asynchronous API calls without reloading the page.
Dynamic Content: Displays search results dynamically based on user input, focusing specifically on government colleges.
Bootstrap for Styling: The project is styled using Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and modern design.
CORS Handling: Utilizes the AllOrigins CORS Proxy to bypass CORS restrictions and allow secure API requests over HTTPS.
Filtered Search: Ensures that only government-affiliated colleges are displayed in the results.

#Technology Stack
